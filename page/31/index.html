&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of all the shuttle external tanks, ET-94 has lived, and will continue to live the most unique life. In 2018, this tank will be at the California Science Center where she&rsquo;ll be mated to the Endeavour Space Shuttle Orbiter. The whole vehicle will be displayed in launch configuration, along with the Solid Rocket Boosters, making the most breathtaking aerospace museum display in history.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Before that happens, ET-94 has a long way to go. As of right now (July 2015), she rests at NASA&rsquo;s Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans, Louisiana. Some time around the new year, she will embark on a 4 to 6 week journey by barge through the Panama Canal to Marina del Rey in Southern California.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;During the course of the shuttle program, three different types of tanks were flown; the Standard Weight Tank (SWT), the Lightweight Tank (LWT) and the Super Lightweight Tank (SLWT). The SLWT allowed more payload to be carried to a higher inclination orbit, but it was more expensive. Thus, on missions where weight and orbit inclination requirements were not critical, NASA could use the less expensive LWT. The manufacture of three LWTs was deferred after the development of the SLWT, and manifested for future science missions.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The first of these deferred-build LWTs (ET-93), flew on STS-107, the tragic final flight of Columbia. The identical ET-94 was examined during the Columbia investigation, resulting in much of the foam being removed. The California Science Center will touch up these scars before she is put on display.

For more photos of this damage, see my previous article about ET-94 (click here).&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ET-94 would have flown after the Columbia investigation, but the accident resulted in a change of the shuttle mission manifest, eliminating all future science missions. All subsequent missions were destined to fly to the International Space Station or the Hubble Space Telescope, which require the performance increase offered by a SLWT. The second deferred-build tank (ET-94) would never fly, and the third (ET-95) would never be fully assembled.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We are fortunate to have external tank flight hardware leftover from the Shuttle Program, but this is a consequence of a tragic situation. A similar statement can be said for Endeavour herself as the replacement for the Challenger orbiter, lost in 1986. The magnificent future display at the California Science Center will include representatives related to both shuttle accidents as a silent but powerful monument to the crews and ships that we lost. For those who know the history of this hardware, seeing ET-94 and Endeavour stacked together will be an emotional event.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of all the shuttle external tanks, ET-94 has lived, and will continue to live the most unique life. In 2018, this tank will be at the California Science Center where she&rsquo;ll be mated to the Endeavour Space Shuttle Orbiter. The whole vehicle will be displayed in launch configuration, along with the Solid Rocket Boosters, making the most breathtaking aerospace museum display in history.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Before that happens, ET-94 has a long way to go. As of right now (July 2015), she rests at NASA&rsquo;s Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans, Louisiana. Some time around the new year, she will embark on a 4 to 6 week journey by barge through the Panama Canal to Marina del Rey in Southern California.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;During the course of the shuttle program, three different types of tanks were flown; the Standard Weight Tank (SWT), the Lightweight Tank (LWT) and the Super Lightweight Tank (SLWT). The SLWT allowed more payload to be carried to a higher inclination orbit, but it was more expensive. Thus, on missions where weight and orbit inclination requirements were not critical, NASA could use the less expensive LWT. The manufacture of three LWTs was deferred after the development of the SLWT, and manifested for future science missions.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The first of these deferred-build LWTs (ET-93), flew on STS-107, the tragic final flight of Columbia. The identical ET-94 was examined during the Columbia investigation, resulting in much of the foam being removed. The California Science Center will touch up these scars before she is put on display.

For more photos of this damage, see my previous article about ET-94 (click here).&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ET-94 would have flown after the Columbia investigation, but the accident resulted in a change of the shuttle mission manifest, eliminating all future science missions. All subsequent missions were destined to fly to the International Space Station or the Hubble Space Telescope, which require the performance increase offered by a SLWT. The second deferred-build tank (ET-94) would never fly, and the third (ET-95) would never be fully assembled.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We are fortunate to have external tank flight hardware leftover from the Shuttle Program, but this is a consequence of a tragic situation. A similar statement can be said for Endeavour herself as the replacement for the Challenger orbiter, lost in 1986. The magnificent future display at the California Science Center will include representatives related to both shuttle accidents as a silent but powerful monument to the crews and ships that we lost. For those who know the history of this hardware, seeing ET-94 and Endeavour stacked together will be an emotional event.
